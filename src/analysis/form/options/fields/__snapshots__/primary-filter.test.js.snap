      All preys that satisfy this score filter for at least one bait will be displayed on the dot plot. If a prey satisfies this filter for at least one bait, all the quantitative values for this prey â€“ even those that did not satisfy the cutoff in particular bait-prey pairs - will also be included. By default, prey confidence will be indicated with a circle edge as shown below:
