      All readouts that satisfy this score filter for at least one condition will be displayed on the dot plot. If a readout satisfies this filter for at least one condition, all the quantitative values for this readout â€“ even those that did not satisfy the cutoff in particular condition-readout pairs - will also be included. By default, readout confidence will be indicated with a circle edge as shown below:
