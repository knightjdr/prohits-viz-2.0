  In this case, a list of conditions and readouts in the desired display order must be
  supplied in the text boxes. Only conditions and readouts entered in the text box will be
  included in the analysis and in the dot plot. Condition and readout names must be entered
  as they appear in the input file name and are case sensitive. In some cases the

  control: `The average value of a readout across control samples will be subtracted
    from the detected value for the condition if this is selected. The quantitative value
    for the readout becomes the value above and beyond what is seen across the control
    samples. Specify the column to use for controls in the adjacent "Control column"
    field. If you are applying multiple transformations to your data, control subtraction
    will always occur first (before readout length normalization, condition normalization
    and log transformation).`,
  log: `If desired, abundance values can be log-transformed by base 2, e or base 10.
    If you are applying multiple transformations to your data, log transformation will
    always occur last (after control subtraction, readout length normalization and condition
    normalization).`,
  abundanceCap: `Any readouts with an abundance value (e.g. spectral count/intensity) above this cutoff
      will be capped at this value in the output image. This is to give greater
      visual dynamic range for lower values when outlier readouts with very high
      abundance are present. This cutoff will be dependent on the data set and should
      be selected accordingly.`,
  minAbundance: `In addition to the primary filter requirement, a readout must have an abundance
      value (e.g. spectral count/intensity) above this minimum to be included in the analysis.
      As with the primary filter, once a readout passes this threshold for one condition,
      all the values for it are returned across all conditions and used in the analysis.`,
  normalization: `No normalization is applied by default but data can be normalized by the total
    abundance between conditions or by a specific readout. If you are applying multiple
    transformations to your data, normalization will always occur after control subtraction
    and readout length normalization but before log transformation.`,

  In this case, a list of condition and readout genes in the desired display order must be

  as they appear in the input file name and are case sensitive. In some cases the

  readoutLength: (
    <div>
      The abundance value of each readout can be adjusted to it length (gene/protein length)
      if a column with length is available in the input file. This option should be selected
      if you are worried the length may be unduly affecting the observed abundance. The adjusted
      value of a readout is calculated by dividing the median length of all readouts in the data
      set by the length of readout i and then multiplying by the abundance of readout i.

  primaryFilter: (

      All readouts that satisfy this score filter for at least one
      condition will be displayed on the dot plot. If a readout satisfies this filter
      for at least one condition, all the quantitative values for this readout â€“ even
      those that did not satisfy the cutoff in particular condition-readout pairs -
      will also be included. By default, readout confidence will be indicated with
      a circle edge as shown below:

    input file works, i.e. are smaller scores better that large scores, or
    vice versa?`,
  secondaryFilter: `Readouts that do no pass the primary score filter but
    pass this secondary filter will be marked with an intermediate intensity
    edge in the dot plot. Interactions that do not pass either filter will be
    marked with a low intensity edge. The secondary filter can be adjusted
    depending on the dataset to allow a greater or lesser number of readouts
    into this 'medium' confidence range.`,
  writeDistance: `Images can also be generated showing the clustered distance
    matrices of either the conditions or the readouts. Please specificy if
    you would like to output these images as well.`,
