  pass this secondary filter will be marked with an intermediate intensity
  edge in the dot plot. Interactions that do not pass either filter will be
  marked with a low intensity edge. The secondary filter can be adjusted
  depending on the dataset to allow a greater or lesser number of interactions
  into this 'medium' confidence range.`,
